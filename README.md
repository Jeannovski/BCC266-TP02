# BCC266-TP02
This project simulates a multi-level cache (L1, L2, L3) and RAM in C. It processes instructions, tracks cache hits/misses, and models memory access using LRU replacement. The simulation demonstrates how data is managed in memory hierarchies to optimize access times, reflecting real-world computer performance.
